I'm interested in way too many things, including: mathematics, computer algebra, functional programming, dependent types, compilers, Haskell, Idris, cryptography, the c64, synthesizers and electronics.

You can find some of my stuff on [darcshub](https://hub.darcs.net/bkomuves/) and [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/user/BalazsKomuves), too.
